            <h1 class="mt-md-5" style="text-align:left;">Own vpn.</h1>
            <p class="mt-md-3 ms-md-2">When I was on my new school I wanted a vpn, because the school wifi blocked many things so I made my first vpn with wireguard. But that uses udp protocol and that is blocked on oure school network so I needed to find a other way to access a vpn. So I installed pivpn where I can configure openvpn so it uses tcp and tcp is not blocked. now i have a vpn for my phone so i cant be blocked by my school.</p>
            <h1 class="mt-md-5">Openvpn on chromebook.</h1>
            <p class="mt-md-3 ms-md-2">It sounds simple to add a vpn on a chromebook because you can download the openvpn app and import the vpn. But it was not that simple because I wanted the vpn on my school account and that was the difficult thing because i cant install the openvpn app. So I needed to use the build in vpn of my chromebook. So I imported the certificate and it didn't work. Later I tried a other way and that worked. But I'm not gonna tell that now because then my school know how to block it. I will change the website on 01/02/2025.</p>
            <h1 class="mt-md-5">Own nas.</h1>
            <p class="mt-md-3 ms-md-2"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A nas what is it and what does it do? That is what I thinked. Why do people need a nas? and why is it so useful? A nas stands for network attached storage. The thing that you do with a nas is different between people. You can store files or run virtual machines on them. Or even docker containers. The thing that I did with a nas is just saving files so that I have a back-up for my files of my pc and phone. The program I used for a nas was Truenas Core. It is an easy to run software and it is low weight. Later I decided to switch to Truenas Scale. It is a better version of Truenas core. The main difference is that Truenas core runs on FreeBSD and Truenas Scale on Debian. I used an old laptop for Truenas Scale and Core. They are good software for beginners and it is easy to use.</span></p>
            <h1 class="mt-md-5">Own dashboard.</h1>

            <h1 class="mt-md-5">Making a reverse proxy.</h1>
            <p class="mt-md-3 ms-md-2"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A reverse proxy is not the same as an vpn. With an VPN you are on the network but with a proxy you connect to it but don't get an ip from it. A proxy is good when people want to use your apps but you don’t want them on your network. I use Cloudflare for my proxy. Now people can connect to my network without seeing all my devices. For a reverse proxy you need a connector. The connector is installed on my Raspberry Pi. Now people can access my apps without being on my network.</span></p>
