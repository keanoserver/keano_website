            <h2>Project Details</h2>

            <h3>Own VPN</h3>
            <p>
                When I was at my new school, I wanted a VPN because the school WiFi blocked many things, so I made my first VPN with WireGuard. 
                However, WireGuard uses the UDP protocol, which is blocked on our school network, so I needed to find another way to access a VPN. 
                I installed PiVPN, where I could configure OpenVPN to use TCP, which is not blocked. Now I have a VPN for my phone, so I cannot be blocked by my school.
            </p>

            <h3>OpenVPN on Chromebook</h3>
            <p>
                It sounds simple to add a VPN to a Chromebook because you can download the OpenVPN app and import the VPN. 
                But it was not that simple because I wanted the VPN on my school account, and that was the difficult part because I couldn't install the OpenVPN app. 
                So I needed to use the built-in VPN on my Chromebook. I imported the certificate, and it didn't work. 
                Later, I tried another method, and it worked. But I'm not going to tell that now because then my school will know how to block it. 
                Here is the link to the GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/keanoserver/openvpn-on-chromebook" target="_blank">OpenVPN on Chromebook</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Own NAS</h3>
            <p>
                What is a NAS, and what does it do? That’s what I wondered. Why do people need a NAS, and why is it so useful? 
                A NAS stands for Network Attached Storage. What you do with a NAS depends on your needs. 
                You can store files, run virtual machines, or even run Docker containers. I used a NAS for saving files to have a backup for my PC and phone. 
                I initially used TrueNAS Core, an easy-to-run, lightweight software. Later, I switched to TrueNAS Scale, a better version of TrueNAS Core. 
                The main difference is that TrueNAS Core runs on FreeBSD and TrueNAS Scale on Debian. I used an old laptop for both versions. 
                Both are good software for beginners and easy to use.
            </p>

            <h3>Own Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
                A dashboard is a useful tool for managing multiple projects and resources in one place. 
                I created my own dashboard to centralize everything I need for my personal projects. 
                This made managing my projects and tools much more efficient and streamlined.
            </p>

            <h3>Making a Reverse Proxy</h3>
            <p>
                A reverse proxy is not the same as a VPN. With a VPN, you are on the network, but with a proxy, you connect to it without getting an IP from it. 
                A proxy is useful when people want to use your apps, but you don’t want them on your network. 
                I use Cloudflare for my proxy. Now people can connect to my network without seeing all my devices. 
                For a reverse proxy, you need a connector. I installed the connector on my Raspberry Pi. 
                Now people can access my apps without being on my network.
            </p>

            <h3>Beginning in Roblox Studio</h3>
            <p>
                I started in Roblox Studio with a friend. We made our first game in a week. That was an obby with 40 levels. 
                After that, we created a cart ride, which was really fun to make. We learned a lot from those two games and decided to continue working in Roblox Studio.
            </p>

            <h3>Making the First Roblox Tycoon</h3>
            <p>
                After creating two games in Roblox, we decided to make a bigger one, a tycoon game. At first, we thought it would be easy, but we soon realized it wasn’t that simple. 
                We started by building the entire tycoon, but the hardest part came next: the scripting. It was really challenging because it was our first time working with such a large script. 
                However, after a few days, the first features started working. From there, it became much easier, and we eventually finished the game.
