        <p>Here are some of the projects that I've done at home: :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project 1 - Own vpn. Time taken: 3 months
                <p>When I was on my new school I wanted a vpn, becaus the school wifi blocked many things so I made my first vpn with wireguard. But that uses udp protocol and that is blocked on oure school network so I needed to find a other way to acces a vpn. So I installed pivpn where I can configure openvpn so it uses tcp and tcp is not blocked. now i have a vpn for my phone so i cant be blocked by my school.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Project 2 - Openvpn on chromebook. Time taken: 10 months
                <p>It sounds simpel to add a vpn on a chromebook becaus you can download the openvpn app and import the vpn. But it was not that simpel becaus I wanted the vpn on my school account and that was the difficult thing becaus i cant install the openvpn app. So I needed to use the build in vpn of my chromebook. So I imported the certificate and it didnt work. Later I tried a other way and that worked. But I'm not gonna tell that now becaus then my school know how to block it. I will change the website on 01/06/2025.</p>
